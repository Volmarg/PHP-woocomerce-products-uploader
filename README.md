# PHP-woocomerce-products-uploader

Script can be tested at http://projekt-woocommerce-massive-product-adder.volmarg.hekko24.pl/scrapper .

This script is connected with crawler so it takes data from external website and then through the UI You can edit scrapped/crawled data. Ofc. this script is not 100% universal. Some code parts are removed since I rather want to keep it private - took me some time to create it.
